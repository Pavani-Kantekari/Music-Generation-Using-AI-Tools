Verse 1:
I walked barefoot through the frozen grass
Felt winter’s hush like shattered glass
The world said, “Quiet”—so I obeyed
But somewhere deep, a fire stayed
Verse 2:
My voice was buried under snow
Where no one cared or tried to know
But roots were growing in the dark
Waiting for that rebel spark
Pre-Chorus 1 (light percussion joins):
The earth has taught me how to change
To shed my fear, to widen range
Each season pulls a truth from me
And paints it where the world can see
Chorus 1 (builds with drums and electric guitar):
I’ve been hushed, I’ve been unheard
Bit back songs, swallowed words
But now I sing like springtime rain
Soft, but fierce, through joy and pain
The world can try to drown the sound
But roots grow deep beneath the ground
With every leaf, I find my choice
In every storm, I find my voice
🎸 Instrumental interlude: harmonica and guitar riff echoing the melody
Verse 3:
Summer burned with blinding light
I danced in flames, I claimed my fight
Not with fists, not with rage—
But with my truth on every stage
Verse 4:
Autumn stripped what wasn't mine
Left my soul on the crooked line
But in the letting go, I rose
Like fire-lit trees in perfect pose
Pre-Chorus 2 (grittier vocal delivery):
I've learned to sing with thunder's roar
To echo down through every war
A voice is not just sound or breath—
It’s what you keep when silence threats
Chorus 2 (stronger, louder, backing vocals rise):
I’ve been hushed, I’ve been unheard
Traded silence for each word
Now I sing like wild terrain
Rough and raw, with joy and pain
You can try to blur my name
But you can’t unmake the flame
With every scar, I’ve earned this voice
With every fall, I made my choice
Bridge (breakdown, acoustic):
They told me “Blend, don't make a scene”
But I was born to chase what's unseen
The seasons turn and so do I
No more shrinking just to survive
Build (kick drum heartbeat, layers come back):
I am the storm, I am the breeze
I am the howl inside the trees
The whisper that became a cry
The silence that learned how to fly
Final Chorus (full band, anthemic):
I’ve been hushed, I’ve been unheard
But I rewrote every word
I sing with roots, I sing with flame
Through every loss, I claimed my name
You can’t mute what grew this wild
I’m not your ghost, I’m not your child
This voice is mine, and it won’t die—
It’s seasons deep, it’s storm and sky
Outro (fade on harmonica & soft vocals):
So let the earth reclaim its sound
One barefoot step, I stand my ground
